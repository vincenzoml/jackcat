# jackcat

A copycat device for the jack audio connection kit. Written because bitwig.

It has 4 ports. More can be added by changing the NPORTS macro in
jackcat.c. More features will be added upon request. Feature requests with patches even more useful!

On Ubuntu, install the libjack-jackd2-dev package and type make. Run the executable and you'll see a 4 ports device.

Enjoy!
